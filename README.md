# ToObserve - AI-Powered Communication Training Platform

ToObserve is a web application designed to help users improve their communication skills through AI-powered analysis and feedback. The platform provides users with a series of training modules and lessons, and then uses machine learning to analyze their facial expressions and speech patterns to provide real-time feedback on their emotional engagement and communication effectiveness.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication system with login and signup functionality.
- **Training Modules:** A variety of training modules and lessons to help users improve their communication skills.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Real-time analysis of user's facial expressions and speech patterns to provide feedback on their emotional engagement.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly dashboard to track progress and view detailed analysis of their performance.
- **Personalized Feedback:** Personalized feedback and recommendations to help users improve their communication skills.
